• Devised and trained a convolutional neural network for driving in a simulator • Applied Keras. Used techniques such as mean shifting, data smoothing, contrast enhancement and dropout to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks. Here's a clip of the car driving itself autonomously using deep learning https://youtu.be/ISmPxcZNza4
