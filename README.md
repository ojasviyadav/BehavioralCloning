• Devised and trained a convolutional neural network for driving in a simulator 
• Applied Keras. Used techniques such as mean shifting, data smoothing, contrast enhancement and dropout to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks
. Here's a clip of the car driving itself autonomously using deep learning https://youtu.be/ISmPxcZNza4 

* Used the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Trained and validated the model with a training and validation set
* Tested that the model successfully drove around the track without leaving the road
